  Create the Platform project as follows. This action will build petalinux,
  build a Vivado project with platform settings, and build a Vitis Platform.
  
    cd ultra96_foc_pkg
    make
    make sysroot
    make
    
    #The created platform is available in ultra96_foc_pkg/output/repo
  
  **********************************************************
  Create the accelerated design as follows. This action will build the Foc
  accelerator, link the accelerator into the platform's Vivado project,
  implement the final accelerated Vivado project, then prepair the files for
  booting from the SD card.

    cd app_ultra96_foc
    make
    
    # The final SD card image will be available in ./sd_card. Copy BOOT.BIN and
    # image.ub to the SD card and boot the design.
    
  **********************************************************
  Using the design:
    - Use a terminal program such as TeraTerm to connect to the Ultra96 uart
      that resides on the JTAG/Uart board (AES-ACC-U96-JTAG)
    - Connect a USB to ethernet converter to one of the USB ports on the Ultra96
      and connect the ethernet to a network with DHCP or connect point to
      point. If point to point, the IP address is set by the foc server using
      IPADDR from /etc/init.d/focinit which currently sets the board's IP
      to 192.168.42.123
    - With the SD card insterted, power up the board
    - Once the board boots to the login prompt, login with:
        user: root
        passwd: root
    - Enter command 'ifconfig' to determine IP address of eth0 (inet addr)
    - Open a web browser and connect to the IP address of eth0


  **********************************************************
  Cleaning the design
  
    cd ultra96_foc_pkg
    make ultraclean
    
    cd app_ultra96_foc
    make clean
