Introduction
============

This is a demo application for the FOC (Field-Oriented Control) implemented with Xilinx SDSoC

Both Web and Websockets are served on port 80. 


Files
=====
* doxygen - Doxygen project
* src - C++ sources
* ui - Web UI
* api - Network API documentation

DONE
====
* Commands to read RPM and angle values - "Speed?" and "Angle?".
* Command line: Read/write all registers.
* Link to the help file as per Antti's request.
* Port to 2017.1.
* Use device tree to find the FOC IP Core or use SDSoC 2017.1 features to read ADC data.
   Rationale: this way it will work with both single C++ code file FOC or with the distributed FOC.

TODO
====
* Check license!

# VHDL TODO
1. Overcurrent counters Ia,Ib,Ic in status registers. Add overcurrent limits to the configuration registers.
2. Calculate stator current: length of the sum of the vectors Ia, Ib, Ic.
3. Link status: new data from the ADC.



Development
-----------
# configure.ac: AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11 requires this.
apt-get install autoconf-archive


After changing Makefile.am or autoconf.ac, run the following command:
	./autogen.sh
